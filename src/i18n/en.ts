      title: "How to Care for Your Gold and Silver Jewelry",
      excerpt: "Discover the best tips to keep your jewelry bright and in perfect condition for years.",
      category: "Jewelry Care",
      content: `
      <p>
        Gold and silver jewelry are valuable investments that, with proper care, can last for generations. 
        In this comprehensive guide, we'll teach you everything you need to know to keep your pieces in perfect condition.
      </p>

      <h2>Regular Cleaning</h2>
      <p>
        Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the shine of your jewelry. For gold jewelry, you can use 
        a mild solution of warm water with neutral liquid soap. Gently scrub with a soft toothbrush 
        and then rinse with clean water.
      </p>
      <p>
        For silver, the process is similar, but be careful with pieces that have gems or enamels, 
        as some chemicals can damage them.
      </p>

      <h2>Proper Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Store your jewelry in a dry and clean place. Ideally, use individual soft fabric bags or 
        boxes with separators to prevent them from scratching each other. Never store all your jewelry together without protection.
      </p>

      <h2>Avoid Chemicals</h2>
      <p>
        Remove jewelry before using cleaning products, perfumes, hair sprays, or creams. 
        These products can cause discoloration or damage the finish of your pieces.
      </p>

      <h2>Professional Maintenance</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend taking your jewelry to a professional at least once a year for a deep cleaning 
        and review of settings and clasps. This will ensure your pieces are in perfect condition.

      title: "Jewelry Trends 2024",
      excerpt: "The most important trends in the jewelry world for this year.",
      category: "Trends",
      content: `
      <p>
        2024 brings exciting trends in the jewelry world that combine the classic with the modern, 
        creating unique pieces that reflect the personality of the wearer.
      </p>

      <h2>Minimalist Designs</h2>
      <p>
        Minimalism remains a strong trend in 2024. Delicate pieces with clean lines and simple 
        geometric shapes are on the rise. These designs are versatile and perfect for daily wear.
      </p>

      <h2>Customized Jewelry</h2>
      <p>
        Customization is key this year. Customers are looking for unique pieces that tell their story. 
        From custom engravings to completely bespoke designs, customization is at its peak.
      </p>

      <h2>Yellow Gold Returns</h2>
      <p>
        After years of white and rose gold dominance, yellow gold is making a strong comeback. 
        Its warmth and timelessness make it a popular choice for 2024.
      </p>

      <h2>Sustainability</h2>
      <p>
        Environmental awareness influences purchasing decisions. Jewelry made with recycled materials 
        and sustainable processes is increasingly valued by conscious consumers.

      title: "The Meaning of Andean Symbols in Our Jewelry",
      excerpt: "Learn about the deep cultural meaning behind each design in our collection.",
      category: "Stories",
      content: `
      <p>
        Each design in our ORO INCA collection carries centuries of history and deep meaning. 
        Andean symbols are not just decorative; they represent fundamental concepts of the Inca worldview.
      </p>

      <h2>Inti - The Sun</h2>
      <p>
        Inti, the sun god in Inca mythology, represents power, energy, and life. Jewelry with solar 
        symbols is designed for those seeking strength and vitality in their lives.
      </p>

      <h2>Killa - The Moon</h2>
      <p>
        Killa symbolizes femininity, fertility, and intuition. Our lunar designs are perfect 
        for women who value their connection with nature and their feminine essence.
      </p>

      <h2>Chakana - The Andean Cross</h2>
      <p>
        The Chakana represents the connection between the three worlds: Hanan Pacha (upper world), Kay Pacha 
        (earthly world), and Uku Pacha (underworld). It is a symbol of balance and harmony.
      </p>

      <h2>Serpent - Transformation</h2>
      <p>
        The serpent in Andean iconography represents transformation and renewal. Pieces with this 
        symbol accompany those who are in processes of change and personal growth.

      title: "Guide to Choosing the Perfect Ring",
      excerpt: "Everything you need to know to find the ideal ring for your special occasion.",
      category: "Tips",
      content: `
      <p>
        Choosing the perfect ring is an important decision that requires considering several factors. 
        Whether for engagement, marriage, or any special occasion, this guide will help you make the best decision.
      </p>

      <h2>Know the Size</h2>
      <p>
        The correct size is essential. A ring that's too large can easily be lost, while one that's 
        too small can be uncomfortable. If you're unsure of the size, you can measure your finger with a thread 
        or visit our store for a professional measurement.
      </p>

      <h2>Style and Personality</h2>
      <p>
        Consider the personal style of the person who will wear the ring. Do they prefer classic or modern designs? 
        Yellow, white, or rose gold? These decisions should reflect personality and personal taste.
      </p>

      <h2>Budget</h2>
      <p>
        Set a realistic budget before you start looking. Remember that the quality and meaning 
        of the piece are more important than the price. We offer options for different budgets without 
        compromising quality.
      </p>

      <h2>Occasion</h2>
      <p>
        The type of occasion also influences the choice. An engagement ring can be more elaborate, 
        while one for daily wear can be simpler and more functional.

        Keeping your jewelry clean not only makes it look better but also prolongs its lifespan. 
        With the right techniques, you can achieve professional results from the comfort of your home.
      </p>

      <h2>Basic Cleaning Kit</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need expensive products. A soft brush, mild soap, warm water, and a soft cloth 
        are enough for most cleaning tasks. For more delicate pieces, consider specialized products.
      </p>

      <h2>Cleaning Process</h2>
      <p>
        Start by removing visible dirt with a soft brush. Then, use a soapy water solution and 
        gently scrub. Rinse well and dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.
      </p>

      <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Be careful with pieces that have gemstones or delicate details. Some stones require 
        special care and should not be cleaned with chemicals.
